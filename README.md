# Conway's Game of Life

## About

Classic Conway's Game of Life
Easy boredom-killing project I did a couple years ago

1 file:
  * main.cpp

## Prerequisites

  * SFML (Simple Fast Multimedia Library) for C++

## Compiling

```batch
g++ -o GOL main.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
```

Alternative: Can be compiled and debugged using VS Code
Edit "miDebuggerPath" in `./.vscode/launch.json` and "command" in `./.vscode/tasks.json`

## Running

The program can be run through PowerShell:

```batch
./GOL 
```
